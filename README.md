# IN2000
## The assignment
During the winter months, we often hear in the media that the air quality in the big cities is poor. Measures
as diesel ban, studded tire ban and rush hour fee have been tested, but poor air quality
is sometimes a big problem though. Asthmatics and people with respiratory diseases are special
hard hit when air quality is poor.

The task in this project is to create an app that visually presents the air quality in
Norwegian cities. 

Desired functionality can (but doesn't have to) be:
 Production of air quality on a map

## Reasoning for chosen case
Mandatory assignment 2 (Group 58)
1. We chose “Luftkvalitet i storbyene” (Case 4). There are several reasons to this choice,
but the most important was the aspect of testability.
With the lack of experience in software engineering (in groups), we wanted to play it safe
and chose a convenient case that was simple enough to implement, but also open to
change and extensions.
In addition, we wanted an interesting case that felt rewarding to work on.
With that being said, case 4 seemed like the best option due to its simplicity and
accessibility for testing as well as the possibility for extensions. We hope to learn from
this experience so that other cases do not scare us that easily in the future.

## Functional requirements
2. The functional requirements, at the time of writing, include:
- A top list over cities sorted by air quality.
- The ability to compare two given locations on the map.
- Ability to favourite.
- Frequently viewed locations in order to get quicker access to them.
- Ability to filter locations, for instance, make locations with higher air quality than a
given value invisible on the map.
- Replacing the menu with a few buttons on the map.
- Asks user for permission to track current location.
The non-functional requirements are:
- Up-to-date data fetched from API.
- Should not take longer than 7 seconds to do a given task (in our user testing).
- Reduce clicks and encourage a minimalistic interface.

## Use cases
● As a user, I want to know my current location's air quality today as well as a
forecast so I can get an idea of next week’s air quality.
● As a user with asthma, I would like to receive a warning if the air quality is too
poor based on a preset value. In addition, a function that finds a given location
would be nice. .
● As a user, I would like quicker access to data for locations I am interested in.
Also, I would like to compare two locations’ air quality.
● As a paranoid user, I would like to disable location tracking at will in order to
preserve confidentiality.
● As a user, I want a map with a visual overlay which displays the condition of the
air quality in a given zone at a given time. Functions like moving around, zooming
in and out on the map is a must.
● As a sporty user, I would like it if the app could help me choose the best
circumstances to go training depending on the air quality. In addition, it should
warn me if the air quality is expected to go down a given value.
● As an easily agitated user, I would like the app to receive feedback in case the
app crashes or some abnormalities occur.

## Goals
Disclaimer! Some of these goals may or may not change in the future.
3. Project plan:
a. Meeting minimum one day a week.
b. Conduct interviews and collect data by the end of March.
c. Present wireframes and agree on an initial interface.
d. Construct a primitive interface by April 10th.
e. Learn to properly use Git.
f. Testing of usability by April 20th.
g. Finish data modelling after parsing by March 18th.
h. Hopefully finish project by 01.05.2019
i. Do at least something, no matter how small, before next meet up.

## Team deal
a. We expect to have a meeting at least once weekly, in addition to standups and
eventually retroperspectives.
b. In addition to the meetings, every member use time appropriate to their skill and
the tasks handed to them.
c. Do not be afraid to ask for help. The true goal is to get wise, we can get wise
together. Get to know each other's’ weaknesses and strengths so that we can
utilize the latter to its fullest potential.
d. I will personally talk to the person(s) involved and attempt to solve the issue from
there on. In case of any disagreement, democracy will be the solution because
we are an odd number. Bavo is in charge to organize a blind voting if people
disagree as well as asking rather dumb questions in an attempt to remove
consensus.
